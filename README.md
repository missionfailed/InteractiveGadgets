**CS 207- Building Interactive Gadgets Project**

Project name: WAIFU 3X

Objective: Create a friendly alarm clock using one to several LED matrix displays.

**ABSTRACT**

This repository contains the files required to light up a 7-segment LED matrix display with the Arduino library MAX7219.

The Arduino library for MAX7219 is called LedControl and you can read more about it here:

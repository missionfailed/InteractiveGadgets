Project name: WAIFU 3X
Objective: Create a friendly alarm clock using a LED matrix display.

ABSTRACT

This repository contains the files required to light up a 7-segment LED matrix display with the Arduino library MAX7219.

The Arduino library for MAX7219 is called LedControl and you can read more about it here:
